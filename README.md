 # The DAPP
Every time you use Blockchain to store anything, you have to pay a gas fee. Hence, to reduce the cost paid in gas fee it is assumed that the institution will use a separate database to store the information of students in different classes. Here, we have used a hard coded Database as JSON objects for the same.
* The teacher will be able to mark the attendance on the Blockchain of students present in the database.
