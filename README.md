 # The DAPP
Every time you use Blockchain to store anything, you have to pay gas fee. Hence, to reduce the cost paid in gas fee it is assumed that the institution will use a separate database to store the information of students in different classes. Here, we have used a hard coded Database as JSON objects for the same.
â—‹ The teacher will be able to see all the students of all the classes where he/she teaches to mark the attendance
